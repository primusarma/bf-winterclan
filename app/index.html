										<span class="text">The beginning</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">It started with the Starseige Tribes Demo at the end of 1998. Having recently upgraded from dial-up to cable, Freeseus installed the demo and entered the world of online gaming. After three months, he founded Winter. Although the retail version was available, very few purchased it; many who did simply returned to the demo community which oddly enough, was considerably larger (the demo was essentially the entire game minus some maps and useless weapons). In less than a year, Winter would gain respect and hold the position of top CTF clan.
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">UT99</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">Winter continued to persist in the Tribes community long after Freeseus left to play Unreal Tournament (UT99). It was at this time that the Unreal franchise became the foundation for Winter and the birthplace of its sibling clan, Primus Arma.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">Primus Arma is born</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">Close friends, Epyos (né Epyon), Lorquas and Freeseus formed Primus Arma in college for UT2004. During the next few years, the team would be exclusive to this series and compete against the world's best clans. Later in 2008, Primus Arma would claim the #1 rank on Team Warfare League's UT3 5v5 CTF ladder and remain undefeated for the subsequent 6 months before retiring from the game.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">Potpourri Gaming</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">For the next several years, Winter and Primus Arma tags were used for a variety of games, none of which held the attention of its clan members for more than a couple months. Around this time, console gaming became an interest for several members.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">Star Wars: the Force Push</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">In 2011, a strong push for playing Star Wars: the Old Republic was made by Epyos. With a little persuasion, a new website was created and a large unified Primus Arma surged onto the scene. The team consisted of several core members and many new recruits. Upon completing most of the end-game content, the game was retired.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">NHL prominence and the PS3</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">There was a day in NHL12 when Winter was number one in the world, but with only two members actively contributing, it hardly counted. NHL12 and several NHL games before it were played by members of Winter, but NHL14 was the game that cemented Winter as a top-25 club in the world. Over a dozen active players contributed daily to make it by far and away the most successful PS3 game for Winter. It was also at this time that other branches of Winter were active in games like Tribes: Ascend and Rift.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">Catastrophies in Tribes and NHL</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">Only half a year after its release, the makers of Tribes unintentionally destroyed their competitive gaming community by re-engineering weapon aim, balance and damage. These fundamental aspects of the game took months to master and once again required practice, grinding and/or payment to unlock and become proficient at. <br><br>Years later, EA Sports intentially left out their only competitive team play mode (EASHL) for the PS4 and XBO versions of NHL15. This glaring omission was announced last second - a mere week before launch. At this time, there was already an agreement among Winter members to move to the new console for this game. Some members had already purchased the new console before this news and begrudgingly opted to forgo NHL for a year until NHL16. Others stayed to play NHL15 on the PS3.</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="subhead">
										<span class="text">Destiny and Fall 2014</span>
									</div>
									<div class="body">Winter is currently active in 3 games: NHL15 for the PS3, War Thunder and Destiny for the PS4. The latter of which is quite active on a daily basis. It's possible Diablo 3: Ultimate Edition for PS4 may be added to this list in the near future.</div>
